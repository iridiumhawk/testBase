You have to set the system property "java.home" and the environment variable JAVA_HOME to a valid JDK.

I have a file called gradle.properties at the root of my project with the following property:

org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_74
org.gradle.java.home needs to point to a valid JDK location.
